# RegionUpdater
MCDR plugin for update make mirror servers every day but you can disable regions to transfer

# IMPORTANT
The config file must be in MCDR main folder (this plugin was created in 1 day for Bastion SMP and I dont have time to see how works config files in MCDR)

commands:
!!region save region-name dimension --- add a region to not update

!!region remove region-name dimension --- delete region for not be updated

to get region name you can use: https://dinnerbone.com/minecraft/tools/coordinates/

dimensions: ov/overworld - nt/nether - end/en

!!region list --- shows you the regions saved per dim

!!copynow --- copy right now the server

example:

!!region save r.0.0.mca ov
